        <p>For my first exploration, I dove into the world of ReactJS. React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Learning React is important because I aspire to be a front-end developer after college and React is used to solve some of front-end’s most persistent issues. React is fast, powerful, flexible, scalable and has a developer community that is rapidly growing.

         I began my React journey by completing a series of interactive tutorials using Codecademy. This allowed me to acquire a foundation of React’s most essential concepts such as: JSX, components, and storing information via props and state. After completing the Codecademy training, I utilized the skills from the it and made my own website.
